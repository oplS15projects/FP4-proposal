# FP4-proposal
Project Proposal is due 2015-04-08 at 8am

Produce a plan for your final project, and prepare an in-class presentation.

Ask questions, as always, [on piazza!][piazza]

## Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be on github, as a pull request of this very file. Below is a template proposal report.

You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.
The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]

## In-Class Presentation Instructions
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation. **Presentations will be Wednesday, April 8** (and Friday, April 10 as necessary). The presentation material is due on April 8 by 9 am for everybody. [See piazza for full schedule.][piazza]

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link at the bottom of this report. The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin. 

(Template follows. You may delete this line and all above it. Please edit the following template to create your report.)

#Project Title: Live or Dice

### Problem Statement
  Trying to translate a simple working code into a GUI version to help with visual aesthetics.

### Problem Analysis
  Analyzing the code is a must. We as a group will have to understand how the game actually works and the reason why the code is writtin in that way. Then we can start writing code to make a dice algorithm and score keeper. Understanding how to make this interactive and simple as possible will give us an idea on how to make the code work.

* Run the base code
* Write a mockup of the GUI (drawing)
* Learning how to incorporate the working code with the GUI Library

### Data set or other source material.
  We are using a rosetta code (http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pig_the_dice_game/Player#Racket) as a basis for our coding.
  It is a simple code that asks for the Players and then asks whether to roll by typing R or pass by typing P.
  Along with the GUI library (http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html)


  As a group we will be reading up and learning the GUI Library past our exploration analysis, first to learn how GUI can
  work into the base code then trying to use that and wrap everything together.


### Deliverable and Demonstration

* We should have a working live demo of the game and hope that we can do our own twists to it (like % modifiers or handicaps that will help make the game a little interesting).
  * Basic buttons for the dice roller
  * Score window that keeps track of everything.

  We will be able to demonstrate how the game works and run.

### Evaluation of Results

* We should be successful if the following conditions are met...
    * Working GUI
    * Running code that works alongside the GUI.
    * Everything doesn't crash and burn.

## Work Plan and Schedule

### First Milestone (04-13)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 
* The basic GUI for the project
  * making sure it's aesthetically simple and workable.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
What exactly will be turned in on this day?
* The working code and making sure we can incorporate the code into the GUI.

## Group Responsibilities

### Charlie S.
 *  I will work on the GUI part of the application which includes the buttons, window and text frame

### Taner A.
 *  I will work on part of the GUI as well as putting the project together.

### Long T.
 * I will mostly work on the code functions with bits of the GUI to understand it better.

--------------------------------------
* All of us on this group project will equally work on code as well as consult with each other when we are working on the code together.

  * For example, each of us are working on different parts of the GUI, and make sense of it together.
