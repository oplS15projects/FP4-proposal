# Project Title: The Sherman Keyboard
### Problem Statement
The emulation of instruments via audio signal processing is a challenging task and racket provides the tools for generating and manipulating simple sine waves through several different libraries. These libraries can be used to create more complex sounds that emulate the characteristics of real life instruments. Our project will be a synthesizer that will give the user the ability to program their own complex sounds by adjusting different settings built into the UI as well as the ability to use interesting pre-configured settings that sound similar to real instruments.

### Problem Analysis
Any musical instrument is an abstraction away from how tones are created and will be a core concept when developing this instrument to provide an intuitive interface. Abstraction will also be used to create complex systems out of simple lines of code. Modularity between the different areas of this project will be essential when developing an easily maintainable code base. There must be a nice and clear work flow from when a user interacts with the synthesizer and when tones are generated by library calls. Object orientation may prove to be useful when developing abstract data types that will be manipulated.

### Data set or other source materials
There will be no external data required for this project. All audio will be self generating through calls to racket libraries.

The following sources, along with any others, will be used as reference for understanding how to modify sine waves to add effects and to emulate different instruments:

### Deliverable and Demonstration
By the end of this project we will have a working synthesizer that produces complex sounds using sine waves. We will implement a number of features available for the user to interact with that will alter the sounds produced by the synthesizer.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know that we are successful when have an easy to use synthesizer that is enjoyable to play. The synthesizer should come with several different features that a user can manipulate and the synthesizer should be able to play any combinations keys displayed on the UI.

## Work Plan and Schedule
First we will create a working UI that plays very basic sounds. In parallel we will research and experiment with additive synthesis to understand how to incorporate different user settings into the UI to manipulate the audio waves. Development on the UI will continue to ensure that it is visually appealing and intuitive to use. Some interface settings should be implemented at this point.  

### First Milestone (04-13)
On this day, we will have a working UI that resembles a keyboard and plays basic tones using the mouse. Research will be done and some basic audio manipulation procedures will be developed.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
On this day, we will have changed the basic tones to real sine waves and we will add more functionality to the UI,
allowing users to manipulate the audio more, including a volume slider and the ability to generate at least two
harmonics in tandem to the fundamental note to form a more complex wave. We will also have the synth working with
both the mouse and the keyboard.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this
project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

### Stuart Tomkins
First Milestone:

A rudimentary UI layout resembling a keyboard that can play basic notes with mouse clicks.

Second Milestone:

A more flshed out keyboard layout that is intuitive to play and visually appealing. It will also feature more complex event handling for processing user input such as playing combinations of keys via the mapping of screen keys to keyboard keys.

Final Deliverable:

The GUI will not be a direct interface into the backend system developed to modify sine waves to play complex sounds.

Overall:

I will be writing the UI for the keyboard, as well as the event handling. This includes clicking the on screen keys
as well as mapping keys on the keyboard to generate notes. 

### Eamon Lightning
I will be using the concepts of additive synthesis to utilize tools in the portaudio library to generate multiple
sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes, and combine them to form more complex waves that are capable of
emulating more natural or interesting sounds. 

### Kevin Wacome 
I will be contributing to the UI by working on the section that allows users to manipulate different sine wave properties to create different audio effects. Also, I'll experiment with different combinations of harmonics and amplitudes to emulate the characteritics and timbres of popular instruments, and provide users with a selectable list of audio presets.
