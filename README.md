# Project Title: GraphViewer
### Problem Statement
We/I intend to create a GUI that will read mathematical equations and give a visual display of 2/3-dimensional. 

### Problem Analysis

I am going to provide myself with an efficient work environment using iteration and recursion properly. To achieve success, working from the inside out might be useful when creating a GUI. I will take the problem at hand and solve it in a timely manner by allocating the proper time needed. The final result of this project will be a piece of software that will graph a user given equation into another view. This program will also contain error checking to ensure input is valid and will never produce unexpected results.

### Data set or other source materials

I plan to use the racket documentation website, and then to branch off with test data of basic linear equations and 2-d plots. I will also develop a basic GUI that will get a string from a text field box. I will then parse the string in order to ensure that the equation is in a proper format. I also plan on using the code for the derivative solver. With sufficient time I plan on expanding on the solver to allow me to take derivatives of all functions.


### Deliverable and Demonstration


At the live demo, This group will produce a system to display a 2-d,3-d graph in a window alongside the GUI. The input will be tested against regular expressions to determine if it is a valid statement to graph. The GUI may also have a feature to graph the derivative of the function. I will also have a feature that will be able to display the inverse of a function as well. The GUI itself will be visually appealing and will be as few bugs as possible at the time of launch. I will demo the features implemented at the time of the demo with test data that involves several different functions.

### Evaluation of Results


I will reach success by gathering all of my results and create a log of my success. This will help keep me on pace and provide me with a concrete list of features I have implemented as well as how long it took me and how challenging it was.

## Work Plan and Schedule


### First Milestone (04-13)
I will produce a basic and functional GUI that is visually appealing and with as few bugs as possible. I also aim to have some of the plotting working for basic 2-d and 3-d functions.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
The derivative and inverse features should be functional. Final fixes are added to the GUI.

## Group Responsibilities

Jonathan Wydola:
GUI, Plotting, error handling

Pruthviraj Pabba:
plotting and the derivative and inverse functions if he is still part of this group?
