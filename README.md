# Project Title: Tune Traveler
### Problem Statement
The idea is to implement the A* pathfinding algorithm with a graphical representation of the grid in which the algorithm will find the shortest path between two points. Several preset grids will be provided for testing. The interesting part of our project isn't necessarily the pathfinding algorithm itself. It's that each tile on the grid will be assigned musical notes so that as the algorithm traverses the path generated, a little song will be created.

### Problem Analysis
A large part of the problem lies in implementing the A* algorithm, as neither of us has ever implemented it before. Graphics and sound are the easy part. There are many methods we have learned during this course that could simplify the algorithm. The challenge is in identifying which methods to use and how.

### Data set or other source materials
Everything in our project will be code-based. Unless we decide last minute to use pre-generated sounds in the form of WAV or MP3 files, I don't think outside data will be required. As far as source materials go, I am familiar enough with graphics to program the interface, but some research into sound and the A* pathfinding algorithm will be required.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
We are hoping to provide a graphical interface in the form of a grid using the OpenGL library, and to draw some interesting shapes to represent the start and finish positions, and the obstacles. If we have time, we may add some "juice" to make the animated portion of the project more appealing.

In the end, the grid should animate to show the object at the start position moving towards the end position along the path generated by the A* pathfinding algorithm, playing sounds as it "walks" over each tile in the grid.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know we are successfull if our "player" object doesn't magically find a way to walk through walls or the sounds don't break my playback device (again). The final product should be able to find the shortest path from A to B and play sounds along the walk there. We can find an external website to check if the path is correct by entering the start and end positions and the walls separating them.

## Work Plan and Schedule
Given that the most complicated part of this project is the A* algorithm, I would like to save turning that in for last and take my time getting the algorithm right. I think first working on the interface and getting things to draw on screen first would be best, since I have worked with graphics before and know how to do that already. Next will be sound, since there is not much work involved in getting simple sounds to play. For the interface, I will provide a grid and some simple objects that will similar to what should be in the final product so the user has something to look at. For the sound portion, I will simply "animate" the object moving from start to end directly playing sounds as it goes.

Last will be the pathfinding algorithm, since I want adequate time to figure out the algorithm and implement it correctly.

### First Milestone (04-13)
A rough estimate of what the graphical interface will look like in the final product, showing a simple grid with a start and end position defined, as well as an object representing where the user is on the path, and some obstacles. It will animate to show the object moving from point A to B, however, the path will walk straight there by moving horizontally, and then vertically, or vice-versa. 

### Second Milestone (04-21)
The same as the first milestone, except that this will include sound, and possibly the algorithm if it is finished by then.

## Group Responsibilities
### Darin Beaudreau
Will work on the graphical interface and collaborate with Xiaoyang on the pathfinding algorithm.

### Xiaoyang Li
Will work on getting audio to work and generated interesting sounds to play, and collaborate with me on the algorithm.
