# Project Title: Graphical Presentation of Information using Racket & Itâ€™s Libraries
### Problem Statement
* Almost everybody is familiar with constructing presentation slides through What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interfaces. 
* Racket gives us the opportunity to construct presentation slides from the scratch; mainly using slideshow library and other helper libraries as needed. 
* How can a well-designed and informative slideshow be created in racket?

### Problem Analysis
* We will be using most of the concepts we learned until this point of class. Recursions, hierarchical structures, HOPs and abstractions such as map to deal with sequences are some concepts and approaches from class that we will be using to solve the problem.
* We will be creating information (data) using Cyberdyne Systems from Terminator, and will put on the presentation as textual content enriched with the pictures, sounds and/or videos.
* Slideshow, Pict, and possible the Rsound & GUI libraries

### Data set or other source materials
*Data will be textual and visual content from Terminator Wiki.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
* Fully functional, informative, and graphically well designed slideshow presentation 
* A minimum of ten slides
* Will illustrates the capabilities of Racket slideshow library
* May also include Sound and Video, as a stretch goal

### Evaluation of Results
* Presentation will have a minimum of 10 slides.
* Presentation will be graphically appealing, well-themed and informative.
* Presentation will include both pictures and icons.
* Presentation may include sound and video (depending of capabilities of Racket libraries).
* Presentation will inform the public on military-grade AI.

## Work Plan and Schedule
### First Milestone (04-13)
* Outline of slides will be completed (w/placeholder info).
* Titles for slides will be drafted, thus the total number of slides will be decided.
* Colors and styles will be decided roughly, can be changed later as needed.
* Draft slideshow will be made in PowerPoint, to be used as plan for Racket implementation.
* Screenshots of current slides.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
* Screenshots of current slides.
* Pictures, sound and video will be added.
* Most placeholder text should be replaced at this point.
* Styles applied to text.
* Slideshow will be looped.
* After the final touches, time to get ready for the final presentation. 

## Group Responsibilities
### Merve Tuccar
* Will layout and implement the outline of slides 
* Will look into the Pict library to research including images in the slideshow
* Will apply styles to text in slideshow
* Will implement the infographics as the content allows and needed.

### Alex Nevers
* Will draft text information to be used in the slideshow
* Will select images to be used in the presentation
* Will incorporate icons where applicable
* Will draft PowerPoint version of Slideshow to be translated into racket implementation
