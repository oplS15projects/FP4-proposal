# FP4-proposal

# Project Title: NoteRad
### Problem Statement
We would like to design a text editing application along the lines of Notepad but better.

### Problem Analysis
	Data Abstraction - We will be using pre-existing library procedures in our design without knowing exactly what code is hidden under the hood. 
	Object Oriented Programming - We will be constructing objects and using encapsulated member procedures and attributes in designing the application.

### Data set or other source materials
Our project doesn't involve any datasets or other materials, at least not that we know of right now. As such, we will be relying solely on racket libraries.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Our end-product will be a text editing application that will have the following functionality:
	- Enter and save text to a file
	- Copy/Paste text into the application
	- Word wrapping - the process of breaking a section of text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page
	
For the live demo, we will demonstrate each one of the features described above. The application will be interactive as that is the nature of text editing applications.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know if our application is successful if it meets the following criteria:
	- Handle entering text into the text pane using a keyboard
	- Handle copying/pasting text to and from the text pane
	- Handle word wrapping
	- Handle saving text to a file

## Work Plan and Schedule

### First Milestone (04-13)
We will create the GUI object for the text editor i.e. the window, text pane, and menus. 

### Second Milestone (04-21)
We will add the text input functionality to the GUI so that the application can handle inputting text from the keyboard and saving text to a file.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

### Neel Tripathi
I will work on the rudimentary framework for the GUI part of the application i.e. creating a window frame, and text pane.

### Muthuraman Lakshmanan
I will work on the inside of the GUI frame such as creating different tabs for the application so that user can use those tabs to interact with the application. 

### Ajay Kumar
I will work on inputting data into application and copy/paste of text in the application.
